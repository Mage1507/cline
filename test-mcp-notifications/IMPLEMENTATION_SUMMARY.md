# MCP Real-time Notifications Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented support for MCP real-time notifications in Cline. This allows MCP servers to send notifications that appear immediately in the Cline chat interface, providing real-time feedback for long-running operations.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. McpHub.ts (`src/services/mcp/McpHub.ts`)
- Added notification handler registration using MCP SDK's `setNotificationHandler`
- Created a `pendingNotifications` array to store notifications
- Implemented `getPendingNotifications()` method to retrieve and clear pending notifications
- Notifications are captured and stored for display in the chat

### 2. Task/index.ts (`src/core/task/index.ts`)
- Modified the `use_mcp_tool` case to check for pending notifications before and after tool execution
- Displays notifications in the chat using the new "mcp_notification" message type

### 3. ExtensionMessage.ts (`src/shared/ExtensionMessage.ts`)
- Added "mcp_notification" to the `ClineSay` type enum

### 4. ChatRow.tsx (`webview-ui/src/components/chat/ChatRow.tsx`)
- Added UI rendering for "mcp_notification" messages
- Displays notifications with a bell icon and styled background
- Shows "MCP Notification:" prefix followed by the notification content

### 5. Protocol Buffer Updates (`proto/ui.proto`)
- Added `MCP_NOTIFICATION = 19` to the `ClineSay` enum
- Updated all subsequent enum values to maintain proper ordering

### 6. Proto Conversions (`src/shared/proto-conversions/cline-message.ts`)
- Added mappings for `mcp_notification` in both directions
- Ensures proper serialization/deserialization of notification messages

## Build Status
✅ **All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved**
✅ **Project builds successfully**
✅ **Ready for testing**

## How It Works

1. **Server sends notification**: MCP server uses `send_log_message` without `related_request_id`
2. **Client receives**: McpHub's notification handler captures the notification
3. **Storage**: Notification is stored in `pendingNotifications` array
4. **Display**: Task checks for pending notifications and displays them in chat
5. **Cleanup**: Notifications are cleared after being displayed

## Testing

The `test-mcp-notifications` directory contains:
- `server.py`: Test MCP server that sends random delayed notifications
- `test-client.py`: Standalone client to verify server functionality
- `test-notifications.md`: Step-by-step testing guide

## Benefits

1. **Real-time feedback**: Users see progress updates as they happen
2. **Better UX**: Long-running operations can provide status updates
3. **Flexibility**: Works with all MCP transport types (stdio, SSE, streamableHTTP)
4. **Non-blocking**: Notifications don't interrupt the main task flow

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notification filtering**: Add ability to filter notifications by level or logger
2. **Notification grouping**: Group related notifications together
3. **Custom styling**: Allow different notification types to have different styles
4. **Persistence**: Option to save notifications in task history
5. **Rate limiting**: Prevent notification spam

## Example Use Cases

- Progress updates for file processing
- Status updates for API calls
- Milestone notifications for multi-step operations
- Warning/error notifications for background processes
- Real-time data streaming updates
