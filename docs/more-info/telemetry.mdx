### Overview

To help make Cline better for everyone, we collect anonymous usage data that helps us understand how developers are using our open-source AI coding agent. This feedback loop is crucial for improving Cline's capabilities and user experience.

We use PostHog, an open-source analytics platform, for data collection and analysis. Our telemetry implementation is fully transparent - you can review the [source code](https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/src/services/posthog/telemetry/TelemetryService.ts) to see exactly what we track.

### Tracking Policy

Privacy is our priority. To enhance user experience and provide better support, we connect telemetry data with your Cline account if you are logged in. This allows us to offer personalized assistance and improve our services. For users who are not logged in, all collected data is anonymized.

We never track your code, prompts, or conversation content. Our goal is to understand usage patterns and improve Cline, not to spy on your work.

### What We Track

We collect basic usage data including:

**Task Interactions:** When tasks start and finish, conversation flow (without content)\
**Mode and Tool Usage:** Switches between plan/act modes, which tools are being used\
**Token Usage:** Basic metrics about conversation length to estimate cost (not the actual content of the tokens)\
**System Context:** OS type and VS Code environment details\
**UI Activity:** Navigation patterns and feature usage

For complete transparency, you can inspect our [telemetry implementation](https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/src/services/posthog/telemetry/TelemetryService.ts) to see the exact events we track.

### How to Opt Out

Telemetry in Cline is entirely optional:

-   When you update or install our VS Code extension, you'll see a message about our anonymous telemetry
-   You can change your preference anytime in settings

Cline also respects VS Code's global telemetry settings. If you've disabled telemetry at the VS Code level, Cline's telemetry will automatically be disabled as well.
