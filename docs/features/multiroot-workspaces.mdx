Multiroot workspaces let Cline work seamlessly across multiple project folders open in VS Code at the same time. Instead of treating everything as one big workspace, Cline understands each folder as a separate workspace and can target specific ones when reading, writing, or searching files.

	<img src="[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot-2 showing VS Code with multiple workspace folders in the sidebar and Cline working across them]" alt="Multiroot workspace support in Cline" />
</Frame>

This is particularly useful for monorepos, microservices architectures, or any project where you work with multiple related codebases simultaneously.

## Enabling Multiroot Support

Multiroot workspace support requires two things to be enabled:

1. **Feature flag** - Controlled by the Cline team (currently rolling out)
2. **User setting** - Toggle in your Cline settings

To enable it:

1. Open Cline Settings (gear icon in the sidebar)
2. Navigate to the "Features" section
3. Check "Enable Multiroot Workspace Support"

<Frame>
	<img src="[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot-1 showing where in settings to enable the feature]" alt="Where to enable Multiroot Workspaces" />
</Frame>

Once enabled, Cline automatically detects when you have multiple workspace folders open and adjusts his behavior accordingly.


## Using Multiroot Workspaces

### Basic File Operations

When you have multiple workspaces open, Cline can read and write files across all of them. He automatically detects which workspace a file belongs to based on the path.

For example:
```
Read the config file in my frontend workspace
```

Cline will search for config files in the frontend workspace and show you what he finds.

### Workspace-Specific @ Mentions

The real power comes from workspace-prefixed @ mentions. Use the syntax `@workspace:/path` to reference files in specific workspaces:

Using syntax such as:
```
Compare these two implementations:
@frontend:/src/api/users.ts
@backend:/src/routes/users.js
```

This tells Cline exactly which workspace each file is in, eliminating any ambiguity when the same filename exists in multiple places.

<Tip>
	When a file exists in multiple workspaces, Cline will show you all instances with workspace labels so you can choose the right one.
</Tip>

### How File Search Works

When you type `@` and start searching for a file:

**In a single-root workspace:**
- Cline searches your workspace normally
- Results show relative paths from the workspace root

**In a multiroot workspace:**
- Cline searches across all workspace folders in parallel
- Results are annotated with workspace names when files exist in multiple places
- You can use `@workspace:/path` syntax to target a specific workspace

<Frame>
	<img src="[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot-3 showing file search results with workspace annotations like 'frontend:/src/config.json' and 'backend:/src/config.json']" alt="File search with workspace annotations" />
</Frame>

### Writing and Editing Files

When Cline needs to create or modify files, he uses the workspace context to determine the correct location:

```
Create a new API endpoint in the backend workspace for user authentication
```

Cline will create the file in the backend workspace, not the frontend or any other workspace you have open.

If you're working with files that exist in multiple workspaces, be explicit about which one you want. For example:

```
Update the error handling in @backend:/src/utils/errors.js
```

This ensures Cline modifies the right file, even if `errors.js` exists in other workspaces too.

## Auto-Approve with Multiroot Workspaces

Auto-approve permissions work across all your workspaces. When you enable "Read project files" or "Edit project files," those permissions apply to all workspace folders.

If you want to restrict Cline's access to specific workspaces, you'll need to:
- Close the workspaces you don't want him accessing
- Or use the "Read all files" / "Edit all files" permissions more carefully

<Tip>
	I personally keep auto-approve for reading enabled across all my workspaces since it speeds up Cline's ability to gather context. For editing, I review each change regardless of which workspace it's in.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Organizing Your Workspaces

When working with multiroot workspaces, clear naming helps Cline understand your project structure:

- Use descriptive workspace names: `frontend`, `backend`, `shared` instead of `app1`, `app2`, `lib`
- Keep related projects together in the same VS Code workspace
- Close workspaces you're not actively working on to reduce noise

### Being Explicit in Your Requests

The more specific you are about which workspace you're targeting, the better Cline can help:

**Vague:**
```
Fix the authentication bug
```

**Better:**
```
Fix the authentication bug in the backend workspace
```

**Best:**
```
Fix the authentication bug in @backend:/src/auth/login.js
```

### Handling Duplicate Files

When you have files with the same name in multiple workspaces, always use workspace-prefixed mentions:

```
I need to update the README in both workspaces:
@frontend:/README.md should mention the new component library
@backend:/README.md should document the new API endpoints
```

This prevents Cline from getting confused about which file you're referring to.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Workspace names not showing in autocomplete">
    Currently, when you type `@` in a multiroot workspace, the autocomplete menu doesn't show available workspace names. You need to manually type the workspace prefix like `@frontend:/path`.
    
    This is a known limitation that will be addressed in a future update. For now, you can:
    - Check your VS Code sidebar to see your workspace names
    - Type the workspace prefix manually
    - Use the file search without a workspace prefix and Cline will show you which workspace each result is from
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cline can't find files in my workspace">
    If Cline is having trouble finding files:
    - Verify the workspace is actually open in VS Code (check the sidebar)
    - Make sure multiroot support is enabled in Cline settings
    - Try using the full workspace-prefixed path: `@workspace:/full/path/to/file`
    - Restart VS Code if you just added a new workspace folder
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wrong workspace being modified">
    If Cline is modifying files in the wrong workspace:
    - Always use workspace-prefixed @ mentions for files that exist in multiple places
    - Be explicit in your requests about which workspace you're targeting
    - Check that your workspace names are clear and descriptive
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Auto-approve not working as expected">
    Auto-approve permissions apply to all workspaces equally. If you need different permissions for different workspaces:
    - Close workspaces you don't want Cline accessing
    - Use manual approval for sensitive operations
    - Consider using separate VS Code windows for projects with different security requirements

## Technical Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Workspace Detection">
    When you open VS Code with multiple workspace folders, Cline:
    - Detects all workspace roots through VS Code's workspace API
    - Stores workspace metadata (name, path) for each folder
    - Uses this information to resolve file paths and search queries
    - Falls back to single-workspace behavior if only one folder is open
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="File Search Implementation">
    In multiroot mode, file searches work differently:
    - Searches run in parallel across all workspace folders
    - Results are merged and deduplicated
    - When the same path exists in multiple workspaces, each instance is returned with workspace annotations
    - Workspace hints (`@workspace:/path`) filter searches to specific folders
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Path Resolution">
    Cline resolves file paths using this logic:
    1. If a workspace prefix is provided (`@workspace:/path`), use that workspace
    2. If the file exists in only one workspace, use that one
    3. If the file exists in multiple workspaces, show all instances with workspace labels
    4. For new files, use context from the conversation to determine the target workspace
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Backward Compatibility">
    Multiroot support is fully backward compatible:
    - Single-workspace projects work exactly as before
    - All existing @ mention syntax continues to work
    - The feature only activates when multiple workspace folders are detected
    - Disabling the setting reverts to single-workspace behavior
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
