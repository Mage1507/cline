# Voice Recording

Cline supports voice recording functionality that allows you to record audio messages directly in the chat interface. Your voice is automatically transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper model.

## How It Works

1. **Click the microphone button** in the chat input area
2. **Speak your message** - the button will show a red recording indicator
3. **Click the stop button** when finished
4. **Wait for transcription** - you'll see "[Transcribing...]" in the input field
5. **Review and send** - the transcribed text appears in the input field

## Requirements

### OpenAI API Key

Voice transcription requires an OpenAI API key to use the Whisper model. The voice feature will automatically search for any configured OpenAI key in your settings, regardless of which provider you're using for chat.

You can configure an OpenAI key in any of these ways:

-   As your main chat provider (OpenAI or OpenAI Native)
-   Just having an OpenAI key saved in settings (even if using a different chat provider)

### Audio Recording Tools

-   **macOS**: Uses SoX (`rec` command) - install with `brew install sox`
-   **Linux**: Uses ALSA (`arecord` command) - usually pre-installed
-   **Windows**: Uses SoX - download from the official website

## Technical Details

### Independent from Chat Provider

The voice transcription feature is completely independent from your chat provider selection. This means:

-   You can use Claude, GPT-4, or any other model for chat
-   Voice transcription will always use OpenAI's Whisper model
-   As long as you have an OpenAI API key configured somewhere, voice will work

### Audio Format

-   Records in WAV format at system default sample rate
-   Mono channel for optimal speech recognition
-   16-bit encoding for quality

### Privacy & Security

-   Audio is recorded locally on your machine
-   Only the audio file is sent to OpenAI for transcription
-   No audio is stored after transcription
-   Temporary files are automatically cleaned up

## Troubleshooting

### "No OpenAI API key found"

Make sure you have configured an OpenAI API key in Cline's settings. You don't need to switch to OpenAI as your chat provider - just having the key saved is enough.

### "Failed to start recording"

Ensure you have the required audio recording tools installed:

-   macOS: `brew install sox`
-   Linux: `arecord` should be pre-installed
-   Windows: Download SoX from the official website

### "Transcription failed"

Check that:

-   Your OpenAI API key is valid
-   You have sufficient OpenAI API credits
-   Your internet connection is stable

## API Usage

Voice transcription uses the OpenAI Whisper API, which is billed separately from chat completions. Check OpenAI's pricing page for current rates.
