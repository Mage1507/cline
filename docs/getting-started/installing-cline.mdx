### Installation Methods

1. **VS Code Marketplace (Recommended):** Fastest method for standard VS Code and Cursor users.
2. **Open VSX Registry:** For VS Code-compatible editors like VSCodium.

### Method 1: VS Code Marketplace

Follow these steps to get Cline up and running:

1.  **Open VS Code:** Launch the VS Code application.

    > **Note:** If VS Code shows "Running extensions might...", click "Allow".

2.  **Open Your Cline Folder:** In VS Code, open the Cline folder you created in Documents. (Or create a folder named "Cline" if there isn't one already in Documents)

		style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
	/>
</Frame>

3.  **Navigate to Extensions:** Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code (`Ctrl + Shift + X` or `Cmd + Shift + X`).
4.  **Search for 'Cline':** In the Extensions search bar, type `Cline`.
5.  **Install the Extension:** Click the "Install" button next to the Cline extension.
